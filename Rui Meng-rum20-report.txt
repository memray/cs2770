    The trick thing is, the batch size of Caffe is strict. Thus for the last batch

2. Accuracy of pretrained model using SVM, and confusion matrix.
    Accuracy = 0.246228

3. Accuracy of trained model without SVM.



4. Accuracy of trained model using SVM.
5. Plot of train losses and validation accuracies.
