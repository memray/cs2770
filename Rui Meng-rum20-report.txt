Homework 1 Report - Rui Meng
1. Setting up and splitting the data correctly.
    I simply split the data by their indexes, that is I choose the data which index in [:len(data)*0.8] as training, [len(data)*0.8:len(data)*0.9] as validation and the remaining as testing data.
    The trick thing is, the batch size of Caffe is strict. Thus the data in the last batch will be disgarded, which leads to the case that the data number of Part2 is slightly different from the one in Part3 and 4.

2. Accuracy of pretrained model using SVM, and confusion matrix.
    Accuracy = 0.246228

3. Accuracy of trained model without SVM.
    Test #(data)=1657, #(corect)=901, accuracy=0.543754

4. Accuracy of trained model using SVM.
    Accuracy = 0.246228

5. Plot of train losses and validation accuracies.
